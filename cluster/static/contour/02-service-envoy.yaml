    # This annotation puts the AWS ELB into "TCP" mode so that it does not
    # do HTTP negotiation for HTTPS connections at the ELB edge.
    # The downside of this is the remote IP address of all connections will
    # appear to be the internal address of the ELB. See docs/proxy-proto.md
    # for information about enabling the PROXY protocol on the ELB to recover
    # the original remote IP address.
